The public part of the code for IsItWeekA.com

Everything is here except for settings.php (this contains DB passwords etc.)

Back-end is PHP, front-end is Bootstrap (entirety of css, img and js folders are from Bootstrap).

I've since handed the domain name over to [George Hynes](https://github.com/techybyte), so this code doesn't power it anymore.
